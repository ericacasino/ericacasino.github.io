                   <p>I am proud of my mom because she managed everything even if she's alone. She raised us on her own. She endured all the hardships and sacrifices just to provide for me and my siblings. Even though she only has a simple job, she works hard just to send us support. That's why I am very proud of her. She never asked for help from others just to ensure that we have what we need. That's why I strive hard for her.</p>

                   <h2>To My Aunte</h2>
                   <p>To my aunt, who has been supporting us almost single-handedly for nearly a decade, I apologize for the challenges we've brought to your life. Thank you very much for guiding me in my upbringing. We are immensely grateful that we became part of your life. If not for you, we might not be on the right path now. If there are any personal misunderstandings between us, I hope we can resolve them soon. Hopefully, everything will be okay for all of us, and our mother will be okay too.</p>

                   <h2>To My Special Someone</h2>
                   <p>To my special someone, I didn't expect that you would come into my life. I thought it was just a joke and wouldn't happen anytime soon. I took a risk back then just to move on from my crush because I felt I had no chance with her. I thought we'd cross paths during Christmas, but why did we end up celebrating Christmas together, hahaha. But seriously, I am very grateful that you entered my life. My prayers were heard by the Lord that I would have a righteous partner. You are my first true love that lasted, and I hope you'll be my last, hehehe</p>
